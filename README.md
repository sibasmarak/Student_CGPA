# Student_CGPA
CGPA of Students

**The dataset is available with the owner**

```Updates with each year```

- Currently it has only the data of around 1400 students. 
- With each year, new addition would be done to it. 

This would help to determine if a trained model can predict the scores of the students. 
Currently, it assumes the CGPA of the students are known for the first and second semester and tries to predict the CGPA of the third semester. It shows some promising results for most, except for some obvious outliers.

Later this would be improved with time to more semesters as data accumulates.
